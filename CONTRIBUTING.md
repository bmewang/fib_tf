**fib_tf** is a Python framework developed on the top of [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) for 2D cardiac electrophysiology simulation. Its main goal is to test differnt ideas on how to solve ordinary differntial equations using TensorFlow. As such, the scope of **fib_tf** is not limited to cardiac electrophysiology and modeling ionic models. *We love contributation to **fib_tf** and encourage expanding its usage to other areas and applications*. 



Fork, then clone the repo from the *master* branch. Install the pre-requisite softwares as described in [README](README.md). 

You can test the installation as:

```python
python3 fenton.py
```
