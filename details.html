<h2><span class='svtsim'>fib_tf</span>: A Tensorflow-based Cardiac Electrophysiology Modeling Framework</h3>
<h3>Background</h3><hr>
<p>
<a href='https://www.tensorflow.org'>Tensorflow</a> is a machine-learning framework developed by Google and initially released publicly in 2015.
Its website claims that "TensorFlow is a tool for machine learning. While it contains a wide range of functionality,
TensorFlow is mainly designed for deep neural network models." Here, our goal is to test "a wide range of functionality" part of the claim.
Specially, we want to test the suitability of Tensorflow in solving coupled systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) that arise in modeling
cardiac electrophysiology.

<p>
TensorFlow is primarily, but not exclusively, a machine learning framework. However, TensorFlow graphs are powerful
models that can be useful in variety of non-machine learning applications. In fact, the TensorFlow website has an
<a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/pdes'>example</a> of solving a simple partial differential equation.
This example was the starting point of the current project; albeit, in the end, only a tiny fraction of the its codes remained.

<p>
TensorFlow applications generally have two main stages. In the first stage, a TensorFlow graph is defined.
A TensorFlow graph is a directed acyclic graph (with some exceptions to the acyclicity), where nodes correspond
to tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) or operations on tensors, and links denote data movement among the nodes.

<p>
The main power of TensorFlow is the ability to run the model graphs on heterogeneous hardwares,
including CPU, GPU, or even Google developed Tensor Processing Units (TPU).

<h3>Introduction to <span class='svtsim'>fib_tf</span></h3><hr>
<p>
<span class='svtsim'>fib_tf</span> is a python framework developed on the top of TensorFlow for 2D cardiac
electrophysiology simulation using explicit Euler method.
<p>
<span class='svtsim'>fib_tf</span> is designed to run the model on GPU.
Explicit Cardiac electrophysiology models are particuarly suitable for running on GPU, as the main dependency between ODEs
is through Laplacian, which is only a small fraction of the total computational cost.
<p>
Our goal is to optimize the <span class='svtsim'>fib_tf</span> code to make its running time close
to a hand-optimized CUDA C++ code running the same model.
<p>
In this document, we first describe a straight forward translation of cardiac models into TensorFlow. We then explains
variuos optimizing tricks needed to make <span class='svtsim'>fib_tf</span> performace acceptable (of course, it is still far
from hand-optimized codes).
